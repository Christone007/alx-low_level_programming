# DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
Sometimes we need to manually allocate memory for a program
at runtime. This is because we may not know how much space to
reserve at Compile time.  

Dynamic memory allocation is achieved using the **malloc** function
from the standard library <stdlib.h>. When we allocate memory dynamically,
we must deallocate the memory manually too. Memory deallocation is achieved
with the help of the **free** function.
