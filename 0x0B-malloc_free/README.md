# DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
Sometimes we need to manually allocate memory for a program
at runtime. This is because we may not know how much space to
reserve at Compile time.  

Dynamic memory allocation is achieved using the **malloc** function
from the standard library <stdlib.h>. When we allocate memory dynamically,
we must deallocate the memory manually too. Memory deallocation is achieved
with the help of the **free** function.

## Tasks  
0. Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char  
1. Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter
2. Write a function that concatenates two strings  
3. Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2-D array of integers
4. Write a function that frees a 2 D grid created in Task 3

## Task Quotes  
0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee  
1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings
2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
