# SINGLY LINKED LISTS

## Introduction
Singly linked lists are a type of derived data structures
which is made up of nodes. Each node contains a field for
data as well as a pointer to the next node. The first node
is the HEAD and the last node points to NULL.

singly linked lists are the second most-used data structures
after arrays.

It is easy to add\delete nodes from lists compared to arrays
however, it is not very efficient to search compared to arrays
