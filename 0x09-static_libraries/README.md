# BUILDING STATIC LIBRARIES
Libraries are archive files which are a collection
of object files. When a library is statically linked to a
program, the library is embedded into the program's executable
in such a way that the executable is self-sufficient.  

A static library is made up of functions that are very frequently
used. A library prevents us from re-inventing the wheel.

## Tasks

## Task Quotes
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life  
1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
