### Tasks  
0. Memset  
 A function that fills memory with a constant byte
 > char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
1. Memcpy 
 A function that copies an area of memory to another  
 > char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);  
2. Strchr  
 A function that iterates through a string to find a character
 > char *_strchr(char *s, char c);

### Resources

### My thoughts
* What would one need an array of more than 3 dimensions for?
* When a pointer is incremented using **++**, then the actual
position of the original pointer also changes. However, using
the ***(ptr + i)** format enables us to iterate accross memory
without altering the original pointer position
