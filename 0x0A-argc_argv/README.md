# argc and argv

## Introduction
Programs become more useful when we can pass values into them
to modify their behaviour. The main function of every program
can also receive arguments from the command line at invocation.

Options are also CLI arguments. The tasks that follow ensure 
enough practice with this concept in C programming language.

## Tasks
0. Write a program that prints its name.  
1. Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.  
2. Write a program that prints all the arguments it receives.
3. Write a program that multiplies two numbers

## Task Quotes
Task 0: It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to  
Task 1: Silence is argument carried out by other means  
Task 2: The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter  
Task 3: Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument
